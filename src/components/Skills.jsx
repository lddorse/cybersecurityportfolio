        My training and experience include conducting cybersecurity scans, supporting audits through vulnerability remediation, and performing in-depth risk assessments to guide security decisions. Iâ€™ve led the resolution of complex issues such as malware containment and access control, while managing and implementing security policies aligned with standards like NIST. My work also involves developing phishing awareness training, handling incident response, and deploying layered security controls including firewalls, MFA, and endpoint protection.   </p>
