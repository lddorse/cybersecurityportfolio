          <p className="mb-4">
            Hey, I'm Leo — a creative technologist turned cybersecurity pro. I grew up in a small town in East Central Illinois where
            I learned to value hard work, resourcefulness, and curiosity. My journey into tech started young, but it really took off
            through years of exploring art, audio, and hands-on craftsmanship.
          </p>
  
          <p className="mb-4">
            Before cybersecurity, I worked as a freelance audio engineer, ran an art gallery, and even dabbled in stained glass and
            street art. I’ve always been drawn to the blend of creativity and technology — and eventually, that pulled me into the world
            of cybersecurity, where solving problems and protecting people feels like second nature.
          </p>
  
          <p className="mb-4">
            I earned a Master's in Cybersecurity and hold a CompTIA Security+ certification. My portfolio reflects a range of hands-on
            projects — from vulnerability assessments and phishing simulations to detection engineering and control implementation.
            I approach every challenge with curiosity, diligence, and a deep respect for the craft.
          </p>
  
          <p className="mb-4">
            When I’m not working, you’ll probably find me playing guitar, making something in my home studio, or hanging with my two dogs —
            Chewie (a high-energy mini Aussie) and Pio (my loyal terrier-pit mix). I also love being outdoors, whether that means hiking, gardening,
            or just soaking up the sun with a good playlist.
          </p>
